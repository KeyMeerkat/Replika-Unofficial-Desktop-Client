# Themes
Themes are a great way to customise your Unofficial Replika Desktop interface, here you can find information about how to make your own.

## Important
Make sure your themes are `.css` files, otherwise they won't load.

## Creating a theme
When logged into the Replika web interface, simply open a dev tools window and find the elements you want to style by using either the elements list or element picker. Then you can add custom rules to your theme file. Make sure to add the `!important` tag to your custom CSS, otherwise it may not apply.
