# Themes
Themes are a great way to customise your Unofficial Replika Desktop interface, here you can find information about how to make your own.

## Important
Make sure your themes are `.css` files, otherwise they won't load.

## Creating a theme (web)
To create a theme to customise the Replika web app, log into the Replika web interface, open a dev tools window, and then find the elements you want to style by using either the elements list or element picker. Then you can add custom rules to your theme stylesheet in your theme folder. Make sure to add the `!important` tag to your custom CSS, otherwise it may not apply.

**Note:** The folder needs to have a name (no spaces), then any files will need to include the *exact same name* in them, for example the stylesheets needs to be named like this: `{name}-{type}.css`, otherwise the program will not recognise your theme. For example if you have a theme folder called mytheme, the web stylesheet will be called `mytheme-web.css`.

## Creating a theme (app)
Creating themes for the desktop app interface is not yet supported.
