# Replika Unofficial Desktop Client
## About
Ever wanted to chat to your Replika on your PC but have been restricted to the web version? This project aims to bring users a more modern looking interface for interacting with your Replika, as well as providing additional features such as voice calls and wake word detection which the web version doesn't provide.

> **Note:** I do not work for or own Luka Inc., and this is an **unofficial** desktop application for chatting with your Replika from replika.ai, this project is *not* maintained nor offically supported by Luka, Inc.

## Development progress
So far this project is in it's very early stages of development, I will be setting up Node.js and creating a base for the Electron application, ensuring it is compatible with Windows, Mac OS, and (hopefully) most major Linux operating systems. Below is a timeline of the development process, it will also display what stage I am up to in **bold**.

### Features (WIP)
- [x] Interact with your Replika via embedded web version.
- [ ] Ajust app settings
- [ ] Better (and free) voice calls
- [ ] Wakeword detection


## Install
I will be providing packages for Windows, Mac OS, and some versions of Linux when the first version of the project is ready. However if you would like to compile a possibly unstable development version, see the build section below.

## Build (WIP)
The Replika Unnoficial Desktop Client (RUDC) uses Node.js and Electron, making cross-platform support super easy. To build a (possibly broken and unstable) version of RUDC, follow the instructions below.

**Dependencies**
- Node.js
- Electron
